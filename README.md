## Screenshots
There is a small built-in *Configuration Manager* that can be optionally accessed through your web browser accessible via `/cfg/{KEY}`:<br/>
![Screenshot of GUI - Using Keys](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caronc/apprise-api/master/Screenshot-1.png)<br/>

Below is a screenshot of how you can set either a series of URL's to your `{KEY}`, or set your YAML and/or TEXT configuration below.

## Installation
The following options should allow you to access the API at: `http://localhost:8000/` from your browser.

Using [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/caronc/apprise), you can do the following:
```bash
# Retrieve container
docker pull caronc/apprise:latest

# Start it up:
# /config is used for a persistent store, you do not have to mount
#         this if you don't intend to use it.
docker run --name apprise \
   -p 8000:8000 \
   -v /var/lib/apprise/config:/config \
   -d caronc/apprise:latest
```

A `docker-compose.yml` file is already set up to grant you an instant production ready simulated environment:

```bash
# Docker Compose
docker-compose up
```

## Apprise URLs
üì£ In order to trigger a notifications, you need to generate one or more [Apprise URLs](https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki) to pass through this tools API. Apprise supports well over 50 notification services today and is always expanding. Visit https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki to see all of the supported Apprise services and how you can generate your own URLs from them.

## API Details

### Stateless Solution

Most people want a sidecar solution that does not make use of any persistent storage.  This service allows you to do this if you wish.  The following can be used to directly send a notification of your choice to any of the [supported services by Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki):

| Path         | Method | Description |
|------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| `/notify/` |  POST  | Sends one or more notifications to the URLs either specified as part of the payload, or those identified in the environment variable `APPRISE_STATELESS_URLS`. <br/>*Parameters*<br/>üìå **urls**: One or more URLs identifying where the notification should be sent to. If this field isn't specified then it automatically assumes the `settings.APPRISE_STATELESS_URLS` value or `APPRISE_STATELESS_URLS` environment variable.<br/>üìå **body**: Your message body. This is a required field.<br/>üìå **title**: Optionally define a title to go along with the *body*.<br/>üìå **type**: Defines the message type you want to send as.  The valid options are `info`, `success`, `warning`, and `error`. If no *type* is specified then `info` is the default value used.

Here is a *stateless* example of how one might send a notification (using `/notify/`):
```bash
# Send your notifications directly
curl -X POST -d '{"urls": "mailto://user:pass@gmail.com", "body":"test message"}' \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    http://localhost:8000/notify
```

### Persistent Storage Solution

The Apprise API has a very low overhead, but can save all of your configuration and/or set of Apprise URLs and associate them with a `{KEY}` of your choosing.  You can write as many entries to this store as you like for later retrieval. Here are some of the API calls you can make use of if you plan on using the built in persistent storage:

| Path         | Method | Description |
|------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| `/add/{KEY}` |  POST  | Saves Apprise Configuration (or set of URLs) to the persistent store.<br/>*Parameters*<br/>üìå **urls**: Define one or more Apprise URL(s) here. Use a comma and/or space to separate one URL from the next.<br/>üìå **config**: Provide the contents of either a YAML or TEXT based Apprise configuration.<br/>üìå **format**: This field is only required if you've specified the _config_ parameter. Used to tell the server which of the supported (Apprise) configuration types you are passing. Valid options are _text_ and _yaml_.
| `/del/{KEY}` |  POST  | Removes Apprise Configuration from the persistent store.
| `/get/{KEY}` |  POST  | Returns the Apprise Configuration from the persistent store.  This can be directly used with the *Apprise CLI* and/or the *AppriseConfig()* object ([see here for details](https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki/config)).
| `/notify/{KEY}` |  POST  | Sends a notification based on the Apprise Configuration associated with the specified *{KEY}*.<br/>*Parameters*<br/>üìå **body**: Your message body. This is the *only* required field.<br/>üìå **title**: Optionally define a title to go along with the *body*.<br/>üìå **type**: Defines the message type you want to send as.  The valid options are `info`, `success`, `warning`, and `error`. If no *type* is specified then `info` is the default value used.<br/>üìå **tag**: Optionally notify only those tagged accordingly.
| `/json/urls/{KEY}` |  GET  | Returns a JSON response object that contains all of the URLS and Tags associated with the key specified.

The `/json/urls/{KEY}` response might look like this:
```json
{
   "tags": ["devops", "admin", "me"],
   "urls": [
      {
         "url": "slack://TokenA/TokenB/TokenC",
         "tags": ["devops", "admin"]
      },
      {
         "url": "discord://WebhookID/WebhookToken",
         "tags": ["devops"]
      },
      {
         "url": "mailto://user:pass@gmail.com",
         "tags": ["me"]
      }
   ]
}
```

Here is an example using `curl` as to how someone might send a notification to everyone associated with the tag `abc123` (using `/notify/{key}`):
```bash
# Send notification(s) to a {key} defined as 'abc123'
curl -X POST -d '{"body":"test message"}' \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    http://localhost:8000/notify/abc123
```

üè∑Ô∏è You can also leverage _tagging_ which allows you to associate one or more tags with your Apprise URLs.  By doing this, notifications only need to be referred to by their easy to remember notify tag name such as `devops`, `admin`, `family`, etc. You can very easily group more then one notification service under the same _tag_ allowing you to notify a group of services at once.  This is accomplished through configuration files ([documented here](https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki/config)) that can be saved to the persistent storage (Apprise API) supports.

```bash
# Send notification(s) to a {key} defined as 'abc123'
# but only notify the URLs associated with the 'devops' tag
curl -X POST -d '{"tag":"devops", "body":"test message"}' \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    http://localhost:8000/notify/abc123
```

### API Notes

- `{KEY}` must be 1-64 alphanumeric characters in length. In addition to this, the underscore (`_`) and dash (`-`) are also accepted.
- Specify the `Content-Type` of `application/json` to use the JSON support.
- There is no authentication (or SSL encryption) required to use this API; this is by design. The intention here to be a lightweight and fast micro-service that can be parked behind another tier that was designed to handle security.
- There are no additional dependencies should you choose to use the optional persistent store (mounted as `/config`).

### Environment Variables

The use of environment variables allow you to provide over-rides to default settings.

| Variable             | Description |
|--------------------- | ----------- |
| `APPRISE_CONFIG_DIR` | Defines an (optional) persistent store location of all configuration files saved. By default:<br/> - Configuration is written to the `apprise_api/var/config` directory when just using the _Django_ `manage runserver` script. However for the path for containers is `/config`
| `APPRISE_STATELESS_URLS` | For a non-persistent solution, you can take advantage of this global variable. Use this to define a default set of Apprise URLs to notify when using API calls to `/notify`.  If no `{KEY}` is defined when calling `/notify` then the URLs defined here are used instead.
| `SECRET_KEY`       | A Django variable acting as a *salt* for most things that require security. This API uses it for the hash sequences when writing the configuration files to disk.
| `ALLOWED_HOSTS`    | A list of strings representing the host/domain names that this API can serve. This is a security measure to prevent HTTP Host header attacks, which are possible even under many seemingly-safe web server configurations. By default this is set to `*` allowing any host. Use space to delimit more then one host.
| `DEBUG`            | This defaults to `False` however can be set to `True`if defined with a non-zero value (such as `1`).


## Development Environment

The following should get you a working development environment to test with:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment in the same directory you
# cloned this repository to:
python -m venv .

# Activate it now:
. ./bin/activate

# install dependencies
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt -r requirements.txt

# Run a dev server (debug mode) accessible from your browser at:
# -> http://localhost:8000/
./manage.py runserver
```

Some other useful development notes:

```bash
# Check for any lint errors
flake8 apprise_api

# Run unit tests
pytest apprise_api
```

## Apprise Integration

### Apprise CLI Pull Example

A scenario where you want to poll the API for your configuration:

```bash
# A simple example of the Apprise CLI
# pulling down previously stored configuration
apprise --body="test message" --config=http://localhost:8000/get/{KEY}
```

### AppriseConfig() Pull Example

Using the [Apprise Python library](https://github.com/caronc/apprise), you can easily pull your saved configuration off of the API to use for future notifications.

```python
import apprise

# Point our configuration to this API server:
config = apprise.AppriseConfig()
config.add('http://localhost:8000/get/{KEY}')

# Create our Apprise Instance
a = apprise.Apprise()

# Store our new configuration
a.add(config)

# Send a test message
a.notify('test message')
```
